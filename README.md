## about lonnen

I write less software these days than I once did, and most of what I write is on [Github](https://git.io/lonnen). I keep an updated profile on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/lonnen). I maintain my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lonnen) account for DMs.

## about xor

xor has existed in one form or another since 2005. The current iteration is hosted on github pages, with fonts by [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro).
