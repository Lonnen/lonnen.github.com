# [Speaking](/speaking)

I don't update my blog regularly, but I do talk shop a lot. A few times a year someone asks me to do this with more structure and intent than my usual barbershop routine around the office.

I've done podcasts, and guest spoken at company roundtables. I've addressed legislative bodies, community organizations, and classes at Stanford. More often I get together for an informal chat over coffee or bourbon. I generally prefer dialogs to speeches, but if you're interested in having me I'll consider anything.

Some things I've been asked to speak on recently, in whatever order they come to mind:

* infrastructure and cloud operations
* creating high-reliability distributed systems
* creating high-reliability organizations
* scientific computing and education
* public service through tech
* being better managers
* building better teams
* leadership

If you think I can help, please shoot me an email at <lonnen@mozilla.com> or find me on twitter [@lonnen](http://twitter.com/lonnen).
