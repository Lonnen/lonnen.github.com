A few months back Wells Riley wrote [The paragon of inefficiency](http://blog.wells.ee/the-paragon-of-inefficiency), which got some attention on Hacker News and, later, Lifehacker. In the post, he describes how a [fancy pedometer](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/fuelband) incentivised him to be "as _inefficient as possible_ with physical activity". It's unclear if he means only inefficiency in moving around or also inefficiency of movement, but for this post I'll assume he means only the former.

Wells has conflated a difficult to measure goal (fitness) with an easy to measure correlate (Fuel points). His revelation seems novel, but only because in altering his objective he also deforms his means of analysis. The trouble lies in his measuring device, which is reliable in a mechanical sense, but unreliable as an indicator of fitness.

The trivial effort involved in measurement can make a poor metric tempting when it's so cheap. Even poor metrics begin to _feel_ reliable if what you actually want to measure can't be. Over time, faith in the accuracy of your measurement can begin to bleed into faith in the strength of the measurement as a correlate, especially when its relationship to the unmeasurable metric is poorly understood. It doesn't matter if this is a pedometer to measure fitness, bugs closed for determining programmer productivity, or NÃ¼rburgring lap time as a proxy for auto performance. Over time, the data you have will change your model of the problem.

Wells's wristband provides him a simple model -- more movement generates more points -- one that leads Wells to conclude fitness is derived from poor path planning getting from his train to his office, or from moving around the office more during the day. What Wells describes as inefficiency is actually a compromise of his implicit goal to get somewhere quickly in order to better accomodate his new goal of getting Fuel points. It's not inefficiency, though: it's just a global optimization for an additional goal.

But the new goal of Fuel points is a weak correlate to what he's after -- his wrist band doesn't track things that don't involve arm movement, like cycling, and it doesn't track weight moved. A bench press counts the same whether the bar is empty or fully loaded. Air squats with arms pumping are worth *more* than a weighted back squat.

Furthermore, Fuel points are actually an approximation of energy expenditure, itself just a poor proxy for some other desired outcome -- looking better naked, health and wellness, or in this case 'fitness'. Even a large amount of low intensity activity increases energy expenditure without significantly impacting any of these in a positive way in a healthy adult.

Instead what you end up with is a metric twice removed from what you actually care about, and a model with no mention of what you actually care about. I accept that all models are wrong, but only some are actually useful; indirect measurement is an expression of complexity, and should be minimized where possible. When it can't be minimized it needs to be understood, and kept in the foreground when trying to use your models and metrics to understand your problem.

The next time you go to measure something, especially if you're going to automate measuring something, whether it's for your quantified self or your webapp, make sure you're answering the right questions. Then understand how your questions overlap with what you can measure. Then decide if the gap between them is too large to be useful -- because what gets measured gets optimized. Make sure you're measuring the right things.
