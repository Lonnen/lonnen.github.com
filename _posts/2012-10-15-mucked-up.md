XOR has finished its move to a new domain: xor.lonnen.com

I've established a permanent redirect from its old home at `xor.chrislonnen.com/(\S*) -> xor.lonnen.com`. Ideally, I would like to map `xor.chrislonnen.com/(\S*) -> xor.lonnen.com/(\S*)`, but my DNS host does not give me that level of control over the redirect. Shy of renting a server and using nginx or `mod_rewrite`, I'm not sure I can provide a better solution. My apologies for the inconvenience.

Other URLs related to the primary domain may have stopped working. Cool URIs don't change, but everything 400's sooner or later. Get in touch if you're after something specific; I may have back ups.
