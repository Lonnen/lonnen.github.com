Donal Knuth:

> [XOR] in fact, at one point, was a classified thing. I mean it was used so often in code breaking. I went to a conference in Los Alamos in 1976 where somebody wrote the truth table for XOR on the blackboard and the security man erased it immediately.

from his 2006 lecture titled "Platologic Computation"
