As an additional channel of communication I've cribbed
[Holman](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and opened up a
[feedback repo](https://github.com/lonnen/feedback#readme) on GitHub.
Questions, comments, requests, etc. can be filed there as issues; the
`README` has details.

If it's unused or unhelpful, I may close it in a few months. Other
communication channels still work, but I check GitHub more often than
email, or any other social network. Plus it's public.
