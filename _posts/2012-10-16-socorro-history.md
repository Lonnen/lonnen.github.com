At Mozilla, I spend most of my time contributing to the [Socorro Project](https://github.com/mozilla/socorro). For the curious, I ran the repository history through Andrew Caudwell's [Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource). The result is a silent visualization of the project's history nearly two hours long.

My favorite moment is at ~1:18:00, where we landed a [74,000 line commit](https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/pull/29).
